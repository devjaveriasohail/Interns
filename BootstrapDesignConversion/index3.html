                <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new virus</p>
                <p>
                    COVID-19 is a highly contagious respiratory illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It first emerged in late 2019 and has since spread globally, leading to a pandemic. Common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing, while severe cases can result in pneumonia and organ failure.
                </p>
                <h3>How it spreads</h3>
                <p>COVID-19 primarily spreads through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks, or breathes. It can also spread by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and then touching the face. Close contact with an infected person, especially in enclosed spaces, increases the risk of transmission.
